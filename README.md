# webtool-scrape

### Purpose
This was written to test out web scraping and reorganization of HTML table data. The program was designed specifically for an in-house printer management tool which pulled its data from a database. The URL and other identifying components of the script have been removed for privacy reasons. This modified version is more a demonstration of the techniques involved in basic web scraping.
